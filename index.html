            Even though on the surface these look completely different, the
            moral they teach about how we handle life-threatening situations is
            shockingly similar.

          It’s you or them. Are you going to let them die, ensuring your
          survival but creating a dark cloud that will hang over you for the
          rest of your life? Or, are you going to save them, knowing that you’ve
          extended their life by at least a little, but have placed your own
          survival in the hands of fate? Times of desperation, such as World War
          II, produce many such situations that reveal which choice one would
          make.

          Two brave islanders, an elderly paraplegic and a young woman risk
          their lives sheltering and feeding a shivering, bony figure. The
          German occupation has been devastating for them both yet they still
          found the time and resources to care for this poor, weak child. In a
          neighbouring house, a large man grins as he dreams of his sweet
          rewards the Nazi officers would give him.
          <i>The Guernsey Literary and Potato Peel Pie Society</i> (2008),
          written by Mary Ann Shaffer and Annie Barrows, is a novel composed
          entirely of letters set in 1940s Guernsey, a British island in the
          English Channel. During World War II, the island was occupied by the
          Nazis and throughout the book we learn of life during and post
          occupation. The book explores many themes including the dynamic of
          those that are selfish and those that value others above themselves
          during desperate times.
        </p>

        <p>
          Guernsey had a few islanders that valued their comfort and luxury
          above their fellow people. In August 1946, Juliet, the novel’s
          protagonist, learns about Eddie Meares.
        </p>
        <blockquote>
          <q
            >It seems that Eddie Meares was big and nasty and gave/traded/sold
            information to the German authorities in exchange for favours.</q
          >
        </blockquote>
        <p>
          Eddie was seen <em>showing off</em> his new silver cigarettes case
          after Elizabeth and Peter were arrested, unabashedly revealing his
          guilt. Elizabeth was a kind soul who was loved by (nearly) everyone
          she met and she and Peter had been hiding and caring for the Polish
          slave worker. After hearing of Eddie’s new prize, a friend of
          Elizabeth named Dawsey, to put it bluntly, beat Eddie to a pulp.
        </p>

        <p>
          The childlike reference to Eddie as <em>big and nasty</em> portrays
          him like a school bully. This, along with the knowledge his snitching
          has caused death and devastation, compels us to immediately hate him.
          Eddie’s willingness to betray his fellow islanders, specifically a
          well beloved one, to the enemy for a mere luxury, not a necessity,
          highlights his pure selfishness. You should know that Dawsey was
          typically a reserved man not prone to violence and the reader, at this
          point of the novel, has grown to love him. The fact that it was Dawsey
          who beat Eddie further ruins Eddie’s image and makes this punishment
          feel deserved. All of this conveys to us that we should look down upon
          those who consider their own pleasure over the wellbeing of their
          peers.
        </p>

        <p>
          Contrary to scum like Eddie Meares, there were also islanders like
          Elizabeth that would go as far as laying their life down for others.
          Elizabeth was sent to Ravensbrück Concentration Camp, as a result of
          Eddie’s snitching, and would often help her fellow prisoners. One of
          them recounted,
        </p>
        <blockquote>
          <q
            >Our friend Alina stole a potato but dropped it on the ground. All
            digging stopped until the overseer could discover the thief. Alina
            had ulcerated corneas, and it was necessary that the overseers not
            notice this, for they might think her to be going blind. Elizabeth
            said quickly she had taken the potato, and was sent to the
            punishment bunker for one week.</q
          >
        </blockquote>
        <p>
          Elizabeth was quick to take the blame, ensuring Alina would live
          another day, revealing her Christlike selflessness. In her cell,
          Elizabeth was resilient despite the torture she suffered, whereas
          another girl who was punished died. This contrast highlights
          Elizabeth’s strength and perseverance.

            Elizabeth boldly defied the German authorities in the face of
            certain punishment.

        <p>
          On another day, a girl was being beaten senseless by Binta, a Nazi
          officer.
        </p>
        <blockquote>
          <q
            >Elizabeth broke out of our line fast - so fast. She grabbed the rod
            from Binta's hand and turned it on her, hitting her over and over
            again. Guards came running and two of them struck Elizabeth to the
            ground with their rifles. They threw her into a truck and took her
            again to the punishment bunker.</q
          >
        </blockquote>
        <p>
          Elizabeth bolting to stop the beating <em>so fast</em> unveils her
          inherent nature of helping others, despite the assured physical
          punishment. All of these positive attributes of Elizabeth convey that
          valuing others over yourself is admirable.

          A few years earlier on the coast of France not far from Guernsey,
          400,000 British soldiers waited to be evacuated. The water around the
          hallowed soldiers' feet was quickly rising in the dark cramped ship.
          Bullet holes multiplying like rabbits, eyes darting, spontaneous
          shouts. They were practically choking on the heavy air. Everybody knew
          it, but who would say it? They were sinking fast and needed to lose
          weight.
          <i>Dunkirk</i> (2017), directed by Christopher Nolan, reveals how
          humanity responds when their survival is at stake, reflecting the
          historic evacuation.
        </p>

        <p>
          One hour into the film, there were a handful of soldiers crammed in a
          small boat being shot at by the Germans. Since Gibson was a French
          <span onclick="imposter()">imposter</span> in a British uniform (The
          French were only meant to evacuate after the British), Alex, played by
          Harry Styles, and some other soldiers wanted him to go overboard to
          lighten the ship. Tommy, played by Fionn Whitehead, exclaimed that
          Gibson would be slaughtered if he did, Alex then retorting,
          <q>Better him than me.</q> Tommy replied that this wasn’t fair with
          Alex finally stating, <q>Survival’s not fair.</q> This lack of empathy
          for Gibson from Alex reveals how in survival situations, our moral
          judgment can be compromised. Alex went as far as preferring a fellow
          soldier dead for his own sake. The constant ticking sound in the
          background highlights the urgency of the situation causing Alex and
          others to irrationally think that getting rid of Gibson would make any
          significant difference to their own survival. The close-up shots of
          Gibson’s innocent face contrasted with the insults spoken by Alex
          teaches us to view selfish people negatively.
        </p>

          <figcaption>
            Gibson's childlike fear and innocence expressed here provokes us to
            empathise with him and in turn, lose respect for Alex.
          </figcaption>
        </figure>

        <p>
          Of course, not everyone on that ship was like Alex. The whole time
          Alex interrogated Gibson, Tommy defended him. He told Alex,
          <q>He’s just looking for a way off the sand like the rest of us.</q>
          Despite the chaotic tension, Tommy spoke calmly and with a level head,
          in contrast to the brash voices of Alex and others. He realised Gibson
          was not any different from the rest of them and so was deserving of
          life just as much. Throughout <i>Dunkirk</i>, the stories jump around
          to different soldiers, making it difficult to keep track of an
          individual. This shows how, despite them facing different challenges,
          they’re all going through a tribulation together, which reinforces
          Tommy’s view. Tommy was a light of reason in a darkness of madness.

        <p>
          We all say that we would always adhere to our moral compass no matter
          the situation; however, as has been explored in
          <i>The Guernsey Literary and Potato Peel Pie Society</i> and
          <i>Dunkirk</i>, we can never be certain until we hear death knock on
          the door. We will hopefully never have to go through the same
          hardships the characters of these stories endured but will still face
          challenges that require difficult decisions. So who will you choose:
