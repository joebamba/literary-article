        It’s you or them. Are you going to let them die, ensuring your survival
        but creating a dark cloud that will hang over you for the rest of your
        life? Or, are you going to save them, knowing that you’ve extended their
        life by at least a little, but have placed your own survival in the
        hands of fate? Times of desperation, such as World War 2, produce many
        such situations that reveal which choice one would make.

        2 brave islanders, an elderly paraplegic and a young woman risk their
        lives sheltering and feeding a shivering, bony figure. The war had been
        devastating for them both yet they still found the time and resources to
        care for this poor, weak child. In a neighbouring house, a large man
        grins as he dreams of his sweet rewards the Nazi officers would give
        him. <i>Guernsey Literary and Potato Peel Pie Society</i> (2008) ,
        written by Mary Ann Shaffer and Annie Barrows, is a novel composed
        entirely of letters set in 1940s Guernsey, a British island in the
        English Channel. During World War II, the island was occupied by the
        Nazis and throughout the book we learn of life during and post
        occupation. The book explores many themes including the dynamic of those
        that are selfish and those that value others above themselves during
        desperate times.

        Guernsey had a few islanders that valued their comfort and luxury above
        their fellow people. In August 1946, Juliet, the novel’s protagonist,
        learns about Eddie Meares.

        Eddie was seen <em>showing off</em> his new silver cigarettes case after
        Elizabeth and Peter were arrested, unabashedly revealing his guilt.
        Elizabeth was a kind soul who was loved by (nearly) everyone she met and
        she and Peter had been hiding and caring for a Polish slave worker.
        After hearing of Eddie’s new prize, a friend of Elizabeth named Dawsey,
        to put it bluntly, beat Eddie to a pulp.

        One hour through the film, there were a handful of soldiers crammed in a
        small boat being shot at by the Germans. Alex, played by Harry Styles,
        and some others wanted Gibson to go overboard to lighten the ship since
        he was French. Tommy exclaimed that Gibson would be slaughtered if he
        did, Alex then retorting, <q>Better him than me.</q> Tommy replied that
        this wasn’t fair with Alex finally stating,
        <q>Survival’s not fair.</q>
        This lack of empathy for Gibson from Alex reveals how in survival
        situations, our moral judgment can be compromised. Alex went as far as
        preferring a fellow soldier dead for his own sake. Furthermore, the
        constant ticking sound in the background highlights the urgency of the
        situation causing Alex and others to irrationally think that getting rid
        of Gibson would make any significant difference. In addition, the close
        up shots of Gibson’s innocent face contrasted with the insults spoken by
        Alex lead the audience to view those that value themselves over others
        in a negative light.
